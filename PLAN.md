## Portfolio Challenges

- Idea for design
- Working with fullPage - FullPage inserts elements into the DOM at runtime, so trying to select them for styling took a bit of extra work. Some of the elements also come with pre-loaded styles with high priorities, so changing them / overwriting them was sometimes challenging.
- Image height and having a parent element's height conform to the size of the images within
- On the Project index page - implementing a color overlay on each link on hover
